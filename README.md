## 1. Project Scope
### Main Goal
Our primary objective for this sprint is to develop a simple, interactive web-based game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with support from GitHub Copilot. The focus is on exploring prompt-driven development and understanding how Copilot can assist in generating functional and efficient code.

### Key Features & Deliverables
1. A fully functional game interface (e.g., memory match or quiz game)

2. Complete game logic including input handling, scoring system, and real-time feedback

3. UI styling with CSS for an engaging and user-friendly experience

4. Copilot-powered code contributions across HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

5. A working demo featuring basic interactivity for the mid-sprint presentation

### Out-of-Scope (For Now)
1. Backend or database integration

2. Multiplayer or user authentication features

3. Full mobile responsiveness and accessibility compliance (basic compatibility only)

## 2. Milestones and Timeline
### Session 1 – Sprint Planning
1. Finalize game concept

2. Assign team roles

3. Lock in tech stack

### Milestone: Game Structure with Copilot
1. Core game logic mapped

2. Key functions stubbed

3. Game flow planned (Start → Play → End)

### Milestone: UI Styling Session
1. Basic HTML layout complete

2. Visual styling applied (buttons, game area, text)

### Milestone: Mid-Sprint Demo + Feedback
1. Present a playable version of the game (at least one level or round)

2. Collect and incorporate feedback

### Final Sprint Session
1. Final polish on UI and gameplay

2. Bug fixes and refinements

3. Prepare for final submission and demo

## 4. Anticipated Challenges & Strategies
Challenge 1: Overreliance on Copilot
Strategy: All Copilot-generated code will be thoroughly reviewed, debugged, and understood before merging.

Challenge 2: Time Management
Strategy: Clear weekly milestones and committed working hours will keep the team aligned and on track.

Challenge 3: Merge Conflicts or Code Duplication
Strategy: Defined responsibilities and section ownership will minimize overlap. We'll use pull requests and peer reviews before merging.

Challenge 4: Miscommunication or Misalignment
Strategy: Daily 5-minute check-ins and one fixed weekly call will keep everyone informed and synced.
